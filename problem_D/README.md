# Proble_D

Use this folder for the class exercise.

## What you get

- `src/mini_autograd.py` — a small autograd-style engine (contains intentional bugs)
- `src/demo_custom_functions.py` — custom autograd functions built on the engine (contains intentional bugs)
- `tests/test_examples_smoke.py` — minimal pytest examples (not a complete test suite)

## What to do

1. Write your own pytest tests for the engine and custom functions.
2. Run your tests and use failures to debug/fix the implementation.
3. Keep your tests as evidence of your testing strategy.

The instructor will later run additional official tests to verify completeness.
